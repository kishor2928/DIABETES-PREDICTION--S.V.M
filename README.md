# DIABETES-PREDICTION--S.V.M
This project centers on creating a robust machine learning model designed to predict whether an individual is diabetic based on various health indicators. The workflow begins with importing essential libraries and loading data from the "diabetes.csv" file, which contains critical health metrics related to diabetes diagnosis.

Once the data is collected, a comprehensive analysis is performed to understand the dataset's structure, including the distribution and types of variables present. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted using a variety of visualizations, such as histograms, pie charts, pair plots, and correlation heatmaps. These visual tools help uncover insights into the relationships between different health indicators and the target variable, 'Outcome,' which indicates whether an individual is diabetic.

After the EDA, the project moves into data preprocessing. This involves addressing any missing values to ensure the integrity of the dataset, scaling features to standardize the data for modeling, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets for evaluation purposes.
